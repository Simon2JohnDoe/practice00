    <h2> Git History</h2>
    <p>Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux
         kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management
        (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002.
        The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the
        product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had created SourcePuller by reverse
        engineering the BitKeeper protocols.[16] The same incident also spurred the
        creation of another version-control system, Mercurial.</p>
