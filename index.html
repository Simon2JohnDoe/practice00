    <h1>Types of Paper</h1>
    <p> There are two main types of paper</p>
    <h2>Notebook Paper</h2>
    <p>Notebook paper is mainly used by students to complete assignments.</p>
    <h2>Computer Paper</h2>
    <p>Computer paper is mainly used by people who have a printer.  Sometimes
        people who don't have notebook paper available will use computer paper
        for taking notes.  This isn't advisable since there are no easily seen
        lines so people might write at an angle wasting valuable space.
    </p>
    <p>Why couldn't I come up with something interesting to use instead of this
        garbage?
